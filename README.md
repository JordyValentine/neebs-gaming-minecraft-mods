## Shader

- **SEUS (Sonic Etherâ€™s Unbelievable Shaders)** - [Website](https://sonicether.com/seus/) 

**SEUS PTGI** is a paid mod available through the developers Patreon.

A free version named **SEUS Renewed** is availabe [here](https://sonicether.com/seus/#Downloads), though it may not work as well, I can't say for sure as I haven't tested it yet.

## Alternative Shaders

Since **SEUS PTGI** is not free and is also quite resource heavy, here are some alternatives for those with lower end computers or who can't/don't want to pay for a Minecraft mod.

- [Sildur's Shaders](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/) - **Sildur's Shaders** look really nice and run well on low end hardware. There is also an Enhanced Default version that's less vivid but still looks really nice while keeping the Minecraft asthetic.

- [Chocapic13's Shaders](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293898-chocapic13s-shaders) - **Chocapic13's Shaders** aim for a high quality/performance ratio on a wide range of hardware. There's bunch of versions so you should be able to find one that works for you.

- [Vanilla Plus Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/vanilla-plus-shader) - **Vanilla Plus Shaders** (as the name suggests) improves the standard shaders and adds dynamic shadows and better clouds. There are a few versions, the "SE" Edition is made to look like Seus v08 (the Neebs series uses Seus v09 making this a good alternative) and the "CE" Edition is styled to look like Chocapic13's shaders.
